ProjectRosalind
===============

Project Rosalind is a tool for learning about bioniformatics by solving puzzles of increasing complexity.  It's like Project Euler for molecular biology.

I solved some of the problems in November 2012 to learn more about bioinformatics and Scala.  


Note:
The problem set has been reorganized since then so a couple of my solutions no longer have corresponding problems and one has additional pre-requisites that I haven't done yet.
